# Prerequisites for the FastAPI SaaS Starter Kit

Thank you for your interest in the FastAPI SaaS Starter Kit! This is a professional-grade boilerplate designed to accelerate your development.

To ensure you have a smooth and successful experience, please review the following prerequisites **before you purchase**. This starter kit is a powerful tool, but it assumes a foundational level of technical knowledge and requires a few external services to function.

---

## 1. Required Technical Skills

This is a source-code product, not a no-code tool. You will be working directly with Python code and database concepts. You should be comfortable with the following:

*   **Intermediate Python:** You should have a solid understanding of Python syntax, functions, classes, and data structures (lists, dictionaries). Familiarity with Python's `async`/`await` syntax is beneficial but not strictly required to get started.
*   **Command Line / Terminal:** You must be comfortable navigating directories, running commands, and managing files from the command line.
*   **REST API Fundamentals:** You should understand what a REST API is and the basic concepts of HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), headers, and JSON.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** While SQLAlchemy abstracts away a lot of SQL, you should understand the basics of what a database table, column, foreign key, and schema are. You will need to run provided SQL scripts in a web interface.

**You do NOT need to be an expert in FastAPI or SQLAlchemy to use this kit.** The project is structured to be learnable, and the documentation will guide you. However, a foundational knowledge of Python and APIs is essential.

## 2. Required Accounts & Services

This starter kit relies on a few external, best-in-class services to provide its core functionality.


*   **A Supabase Account:** **(Required)**
    *   **Why:** The starter kit uses Supabase for its **Authentication** service (handling user sign-ups, logins, invites, and JWTs) and **Storage** service (for secure file uploads).
    *   **Cost:** Supabase offers a generous **free tier** that is more than sufficient for development, testing, and even running a small-scale production application. You can sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).

*   **A Supabase Project:** **(Required)**
    *   **Why:** Within your Supabase account, you will need to create a new project. This project will provide your application with a dedicated database, authentication service, and storage bucket.
    *   **Cost:** Included in the free tier.

## 3. Required Software

To run and develop the project on your local machine, you will need the following software installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.11 or newer.
*   **An API Client (Highly Recommended):** A tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is essential for testing the API endpoints. The starter kit includes a pre-made Postman collection to get you started immediately.
*   **A Code Editor (Highly Recommended):** An editor that supports Python, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (has a free community edition).
